    <h2>What is this project?</h2> 
    <p>In this project, the class is going to break into groups and          build an "About Me" website to apply some of what you have            learned and discovered using the GitHub platform. Each group          will consist of 2-5 students and every member will be tasked          with creating their own web page that displays some fun               information about themselves.</p> 
    <h2>What is this project's purpose?</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is not so much to create a                beautiful website but to familiarize ourselves with using             GitHub in a team.</p>
